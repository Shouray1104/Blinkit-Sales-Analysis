# Blinkit Sales Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes Blinkit’s sales dataset to generate actionable insights and visualize trends. The workflow combines **SQL** for data cleaning and aggregation, **Python** for exploratory data analysis (EDA), and **Power BI** for creating an interactive dashboard. The goal is to identify patterns in sales, product performance, customer behavior, and outlet-level metrics to support data-driven decision-making.

## Key Insights
- Processed **1.2M+ sales records** to identify trends across products, outlets, and ratings.  
- **Low-Fat items (776K+)** outsold Regular items (425K+), showing changing customer preferences.  
- **Snacks & Fruits** emerged as top-performing categories with **180K+ sales each**.  
- Outlet **size and location** significantly impacted total sales and average ratings (**3.9 avg rating**).  
- Insights highlight areas for **inventory optimization, category promotion, and targeted outlet strategy**.

## Tech Stack
- **SQL:** Data cleaning, aggregation, and validation  
- **Python (EDA):** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn for trend identification and pattern analysis  
- **Power BI:** Interactive dashboards with filters for outlet size, item type, and location
